     * CHAPTER 1: What is Programming?
     * 
     * Imagine you have a tiny Robot friend. 
     * The Robot is very smart, but it doesn't know what to do unless you tell it!
     * 
     * Programming is like writing a "To-Do List" for your Robot.
     * Code is the language the Robot understands.
     * 
     * The Main method is like the "START" button on your Robot's chest!
