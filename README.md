# 🤖 Kids C# Adventure

Welcome to the **Kids C# Adventure**! This project is a fun, story-based way to learn programming from zero to advanced level using C#.

## 🌟 What's Inside?
We have 20 exciting chapters taught by your very own C# Robot friend:
1.  **Basics**: Your first robot greeting.
2.  **Variables**: Magic boxes for your data.
3.  **Conditions & Loops**: Making choices and jumping rope.
4.  **User Input**: Talking back to your robot.
5.  **Classes & Objects**: Blueprints and real toys.
6.  **Encapsulation**: Locked secret boxes.
7.  **Inheritance**: Like parent, like child.
8.  **Polymorphism**: One button, many sounds.
9.  **Abstraction**: The big idea without the tiny details.
10. **Interfaces**: The rule book for controllers.
11. **Static & Readonly**: Shared school names and fixed IDs.
12. **Exception Handling**: Catching math monsters (errors).
13. **Collections**: Big toy boxes and scoreboards.
14. **File Handling**: Writing in your digital notebook.
15. **Enums**: Picking game levels.
16. **Generics**: Magic boxes that hold anything.
17. **Multithreading**: Two robots working together.
18. **Lambda**: Smart shortcuts for smart coders.
19. **Test Automation**: Robot homework checkers!
20. **Mini Project**: Building a Robot School System.

## 🤖 Learn Automation
In Chapter 19 and 20, you will learn how robots can check your work automatically. This is called **Test Automation**, and it's what real engineers use to keep their code bug-free!

Happy Coding! 🚀
